# NovaCRM — Support FAQ

## How do I reset my password?
Click "Forgot Password" on the login page and enter your email. You'll receive a password reset link valid for 24 hours.

## I can't log in to my account. What should I do?
First, check that you're using the correct email address. Try resetting your password. If you still can't log in, contact support — your account may be locked after 5 failed login attempts.

## How do I add a new user to my team?
Go to Settings → Team → Invite User. Enter their email address and select a role (Admin, Manager, or Member). They'll receive an invitation email to create their account.

## How do I delete a contact?
Open the contact record, click the three-dot menu in the top right, and select "Delete Contact." This action is permanent and cannot be undone. Associated deal records will not be deleted.

## Can I recover deleted data?
Deleted contacts and deals cannot be recovered through the UI. However, Enterprise plan customers can request a data recovery within 7 days by contacting support.

## How do I export my data?
Go to Settings → Data → Export. You can export contacts, deals, and activities as CSV files. Exports are processed in the background and you'll receive a download link via email.

## What are the system requirements?
NovaCRM is a web application and requires only a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge). No software installation is needed. Mobile apps require iOS 15+ or Android 12+.

## How do I set up two-factor authentication (2FA)?
Go to Settings → Security → Two-Factor Authentication. You can use an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy) or SMS-based 2FA. We recommend using an authenticator app for better security.

## What is your uptime SLA?
